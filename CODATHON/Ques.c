8. Write a program to find second largest number in an array.
9. Write a program to Multiply without using Multiplication operator (*).


14.Write a C program that demonstrates matrix multiplication for two 3x3 matrices,
matrix1 and matrix2, resulting in a resultMatrix. The program checks if matrix
multiplication is possible and performs the operation if conditions are met.
15.What are the differences between the integer and floating-point versions of the
arithmetic functions in terms of their parameters and return types? explain with
code.
16.Explain how the nested loops in the program work together to print a pyramid
of asterisks based on the user input n. Also, provide an example of the output
when n is set to 5. write code for it.
17.Write a program to find the sum of two matrices of order 2*2 using
multidimensional arrays.
18.Write a program to sort even and odd elements of an array separately.
19.Consider a Currency System in which there are notes of seven denominations
,namely, Re.1,Rs2,Rs,5,Rs 10,Rs 50,Rs 100. If a sum of Rs.N is entered through the
keyboard,write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will
combine to give Rs.N.
